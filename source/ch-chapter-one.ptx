  <introduction>
   <p>
Consider a forced oscillator, as discussed in 
<xref ref="subsection-spring-mass"/> of 
<xref ref="chap-higher-order"/>, described by the equation
</p>

<men xml:id="chap7-01">
  <m>y''(t) + \omega^2 y(t) = f(t);</m>
  <m>y(0) = 0,\; y'(0)= 0.</m>
</men>

<p>
where <m>f(t)</m> is an impulsive force. At <m>t=0</m>, the mass is at rest
at its equilibrium position. At time <m>t=a</m>, the mass experiences a
sharp, brief downward impact, such as a hammer strike, modeled by an
impulsive force <m>f(t)</m>.
</p>

<p>
An impulsive force of this nature is commonly modeled using an idealized
mathematical object called the <term>Dirac delta</term> “function”,
denoted by <m>\delta(t-a)</m>, which is characterized by the following
properties:
</p>

<ol label="roman">
  <li>
    <p><m>\delta(t-a)=0</m> for all <m>t\ne a</m>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <m>\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\delta(t-a) g(t)\,dt = g(a)</m>
      for any function <m>g</m> continuous on an open interval
      containing <m>a</m>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
We note that when <m>g(t)=1</m> in (ii), we obtain
<m>\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\delta(t-a)\,dt = 1</m>.
Based on properties (i) and (ii), it is important to recognize that
<m>\delta(t-a)</m> is not a function in the usual sense; rather it is a
typical example of <em>generalized functions</em> or
<em>distributions</em>, developed rigorously by Sergei Sobolev in 1936
and later in the 1950s by Laurent Schwartz, who provided the most
systematic development of distribution theory.
For an elegant introduction with applications, see

<p>
The Dirac delta function is particularly useful for modeling phenomena
involving instantaneous or localized effects, such as a lightning strike,
a point heat explosion, or the sudden burst of dye at a specific
location. Because of properties (i) and (ii), the Dirac delta function
<m>\delta(t-a)</m> is said to be concentrated at <m>t=a</m>.
</p>

<p>
Mathematically, <m>\delta(t-a)</m> can be interpreted as the limit of a
sequence of approximating impulse functions. One such approximation is
given by
</p>

<me>
d_{a,\varepsilon}(t) =
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{1}{\varepsilon} &amp; \text{if } a \le t \le a+\varepsilon,\\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
</me>

<p>
This represents a pulse of height <m>1/\varepsilon</m> and width
<m>\varepsilon&gt;0</m>, centered at <m>t=a</m>.
